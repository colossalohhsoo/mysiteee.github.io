<h1>About me
</h1>
<p><img src="chanellyn.jpg" width="228" height="232" alt=""/> <strong>Welcome! My name is Chanel Jones. I am a Entrepreneur. I starting to get famililar with a heat press during covid. It ended up becoming more than a hobby. Im from Raleigh, Nc and I make my shirts from here as well. I dont havny any children and I am also a phlebotimist, so I love helping others as well as putting smiles on peoples face with my product. I've always loved art and loved to draw. Making heat transfers have really helped me cope and progress through life. I am 26 years old and plan to open many establishments creating tshirts. </strong></p>
